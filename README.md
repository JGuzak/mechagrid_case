## Credits

Major shout out to Steve from Denki Oto for designing and building the mechatrellis boards!

## BOM

<img src="images/bom.JPG" width=80%>

- 1x assembled mechatrellis board and dink-ii board (Boards are available at the [Denki Oto Shop](https://denki-oto.weebly.com/))
- 1x matching case parts for the mechatrellis board
- 4x 4mm M2.5 bolts
- 8x 10mm M2.5 bolts
- 12x M2.5 heatset inserts

*Items marked with a `*` are only required if assembling a multi-part case.*

## Models & Printing

STLs made with love in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [CAD Sketcher](https://www.cadsketcher.com/).

gcode and prusa slicer files can be found in `/prints`, stls in `/models`. Tested with PLA on Prusa MK4 printers.

Depending on the size of the mechatrellis board, choose the right sized case.

For the larger `16x8` case, parts are broken down into multiple pieces. Make sure you print everything.

## Assembly

!Make sure to test your mechatrellis board and driver before assembling with the case!
